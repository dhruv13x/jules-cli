# 🗺️ Jules CLI: Enterprise Roadmap

**Vision**: To evolve Jules CLI from a powerful developer assistant into an autonomous, visionary engineering partner that seamlessly integrates with and elevates the entire software development lifecycle.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (CRITICALLY MUST HAVE)

**Timeline**: Q2 2026
**Focus**: Core functionality, stability, security, and basic usage.
**Status**: Mostly Completed.

- [x] **Stable CLI Structure**: Modular command architecture using Typer (`src/jules_cli/cli.py`).
- [x] **Single-session Jules API Usage**: Core session management (`jules session`).
- [x] **Basic Test Automation**: Auto-run and fix tests with `pytest` (`jules auto`).
- [x] **Local Patch Apply Workflows**: Apply patches generated by Jules (`jules apply`).
- [x] **Structured Logging**: Debug-friendly and JSON output support (`--verbose`, `--json`).
- [x] **Error Handling**: robust handling for API timeouts and patch failures.
- [x] **Caching**: Smart caching for session IDs and artifacts to improve performance.
- [x] **Secure Local Storage**: Integration with system `keyring` for API keys (`jules auth`).
- [x] **Context Management**: Support for `.julesignore` to exclude files from context.
- [x] **AI-Powered Merge Conflict Resolution**: Basic AI resolver for patch conflicts (`jules apply`).
- [x] **Self-Updating Mechanism**: In-app upgrade command (`jules upgrade`).

---

## Phase 2: The Standard (MUST HAVE)

**Timeline**: Q3 2026
**Focus**: Feature parity with top competitors, user experience improvements, and robust error handling.

- [x] **Environment Diagnostics**: `jules doctor` to validate setup and dependencies.
- [x] **Expanded Test Runner Support**: Support for `unittest` and `nose2` alongside `pytest`.
- [x] **Interactive Onboarding**: `jules init` wizard for project setup.
- [x] **Configuration Management**: TOML-based config (`~/.config/jules/config.toml`).
- [x] **Interactive Mode**: Stateful REPL for refining goals (`jules interact`).
- [x] **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Proactive code improvements (`jules suggest`).
- [x] **Shell Completion**: Tab-completion for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
- [x] **Test Report Summaries**: Summary output for test runs and flaky test detection.
- [ ] **TUI (Text User Interface)**: Rich terminal UI using `textual` for complex sessions and diff reviews.

---

## Phase 3: The Ecosystem (INTEGRATION & SHOULD HAVE)

**Timeline**: Q4 2026
**Focus**: Webhooks, API exposure, 3rd party plugins, SDK generation, and extensibility.

- [x] **GitHub Integration**: Create PRs directly from CLI (`jules pr`).
- [ ] **GitLab & Bitbucket Integration**: Expand PR/MR support to other platforms.
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hook Integration**: Local hooks to run `jules suggest` or `jules auto` before commits.
- [ ] **CI/CD Templates**: Ready-to-use workflows for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI.
- [ ] **Public Python API**: Stabilize `jules_cli.core` for external tool integration.
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: System for community-driven extensions and commands.
- [ ] **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications to Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams.
- [ ] **IDE Extensions**: dedicated VS Code and JetBrains plugins wrapping the CLI.
- [ ] **Issue Tracker Integration**: Fetch and update tasks from Jira, Linear, or Trello.

---

## Phase 4: The Vision (GOD LEVEL)

**Timeline**: 2027+
**Focus**: "Futuristic" features, AI integration, advanced automation, and industry-disrupting capabilities.

- [x] **AI-Powered Task Execution**: Arbitrary task completion (`jules task`).
- [x] **Intelligent Test Generation**: Generate test suites for existing code (`jules testgen`).
- [x] **AI-Driven Refactoring**: Natural language refactoring (`jules refactor`).
- [x] **Workspace Awareness**: Multi-repo and monorepo management (`jules workspace`).
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate specialized agents (Architect, QA, Security) for complex problem solving.
- [ ] **"Spec-First" Development**: Generate technical specifications from goals, then implement code and tests.
- [ ] **Autonomous Bug Hunting**: "Jules Sentinel" - a background process that continuously fuzz-tests and scans for vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Self-Healing CI/CD**: Automatically analyze pipeline failures, generate patches, and re-trigger builds.
- [ ] **Predictive Dependency Analysis**: Forecast dependency conflicts and security risks before they happen.
- [ ] **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Build a queryable semantic graph of the codebase, business logic, and implicit dependencies.
- [ ] **Code Genealogy**: Trace every line of code back to the specific prompt or task that generated it for full accountability.

## The Sandbox (OUT OF THE BOX / OPTIONAL)

**Timeline**: Experimental
**Focus**: Wild, creative, experimental ideas that set the project apart.

- [ ] **"AI Coach" Mode**: Real-time mentoring for junior developers with style guides and best practice tips.
- [ ] **Voice-Activated Ops**: "Jules, deploy to production" via voice commands.
- [ ] **Gamified Developer Metrics**: Leaderboards for bugs fixed, test coverage improved, and "clean code" streaks.
- [ ] **Generative Code Art**: Visualize codebase complexity and evolution as evolving digital art.
- [ ] **Semantic Code Search**: "Show me where we handle user authentication" (using vector embeddings).
- [ ] **VR Code Walk**: Export code structure to VR for 3D visualization and architecture review.
