Master Task Plan for Jules-Automated Development of jules-cli

This document defines the full work breakdown structure for evolving jules-cli
from a basic script → into a fully modular, enterprise-grade automation system.

Each task is formatted with checkboxes and written in “actionable Jules style,”
so you can copy individual blocks and paste them directly into Jules for execution.


---

✅ PHASE 1 — CORE REFACTORING & STABILIZATION

Goal: Make the codebase maintainable, modular, and testable.

1. Refactor CLI into modular architecture

✅ Split cli.py into modules:

✅ core/ (Jules sessions, activities, API client)

✅ pytest_runner/ (pytest runner + parser)

✅ patching/ (patch apply & conflict resolver)

✅ gitutils/ (branch, commit, push, repo checks)

✅ config/ (config loader, TOML reader)

✅ commands/ (command handler files)

✅ utils/ (logging, formatting, common helpers)


[ ] Add docstrings, types, interface boundaries

[ ] Preserve all current behavior



---

2. Add structured logging layer

✅ Implement logging-based module

✅ Add DEBUG / INFO / WARN / ERROR levels

✅ Add --debug and --no-color support

[ ] Replace print() with structured logs



---

3. Introduce centralized error handling

✅ Add custom exceptions:

✅ JulesAPIError

✅ GitError

✅ PatchError

✅ TestRunnerError

✅ ConfigError


✅ Integrate with entire CLI

[ ] Improve user-facing error clarity



---

4. Create configuration system

✅ Add config file: ~/.config/jules/config.toml

✅ Support:

[ ] default repo

[ ] default branch

[ ] git settings

[ ] API timeout

✅ logging level


✅ Add ConfigManager class



---

5. Implement jules doctor

✅ Validate environment:

✅ API key exists

✅ git is installed

✅ patch binary installed

✅ repo health

✅ GitHub token presence

✅ internet connectivity


✅ Pretty + --json output modes



---

📦 PHASE 2 — TESTING & RELIABILITY

Goal: Full coverage, stable behavior, CI automation.

6. Add full pytest suite

✅ Unit tests for:

✅ API layer

✅ patching

✅ pytest runner

✅ git utils

✅ config

✅ CLI


✅ Achieve 85%+ test coverage



---

7. Add FakeJulesAPI for integration

✅ Simulate:

[ ] session creation

[ ] polling

[ ] unidiff patches

[ ] PR artifacts


✅ Write integration tests using the fake backend



---

8. Create GitHub Actions test workflow

✅ Add .github/workflows/test.yml

✅ Run:

[ ] install deps

[ ] pytest

[ ] coverage report




---

🧭 PHASE 3 — CLI EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS

Goal: Professional-grade CLI usability.

9. Rewrite CLI using Typer

✅ Move to Typer

✅ Add:

✅ autocompletion

✅ rich help pages

✅ typed options

✅ grouped subcommands




---

10. Add color/no-color handling

✅ ANSI colors via a unified module

✅ Add flags:

[ ] --color

✅ --no-color




---

11. Add history database

✅ SQLite DB at ~/.local/share/jules/history.db

✅ Store:

✅ sessions

✅ patches

✅ PRs

[ ] errors


✅ Commands:

✅ jules history

✅ jules history view <id>




---

12. Add --json output everywhere

✅ JSON output for all commands

✅ Pretty JSON with --pretty



---

🔧 PHASE 4 — GIT & GITHUB AUTOMATION

Goal: Powerful and safe git automation.

13. Add interactive file/hunk staging

✅ Command: jules stage

✅ Git add -p style UX



---

14. Add advanced PR creation

✅ Support:

✅ draft PR

✅ labels

✅ reviewers

✅ assignees


[ ] Config-driven defaults



---

15. Add automatic branch naming engine

[ ] Patterns like:

[ ] fix/tests/<timestamp>

[ ] refactor/api/<timestamp>

[ ] feature/<slug>/<timestamp>


[ ] Configurable



---

🤖 PHASE 5 — JULES AGENT FULL AUTOMATION

Goal: Automated debugging, refactoring, and test generation.

16. Implement jules autofix pipeline

✅ Automated fix pipeline:

✅ run pytest

✅ send to Jules

✅ poll for patch/PR

✅ apply patch

✅ rerun tests

✅ commit

✅ push

✅ create PR


[ ] Flags:

[ ] --json

[ ] --no-push

[ ] --no-pr




---

17. Add repository-wide refactor engine

[ ] Command: jules refactor "<refactor goal>"

[ ] Multi-step plan execution

[ ] Group changes into cleaner commits

[ ] Auto PR



---

18. Add AI-powered test generator

[ ] Command: jules testgen <path>

[ ] Generate:

[ ] missing tests

[ ] edge-case tests

[ ] async tests

[ ] error path tests




---

🏢 PHASE 6 — ENTERPRISE FEATURES

Goal: scalability, multi-repo, conflict resolution.

19. Add workspace support

[ ] Workspace file: workspace.yaml: repos: - name: X - name: Y

[ ] Command: jules workspace run <task>



---

20. Add AI merge conflict resolver

[ ] When patch apply fails:

[ ] send reject chunks to Jules

[ ] regenerate conflict-free patch

[ ] retry apply


[ ] Suggest fallback strategies



---

21. Add local caching system

[ ] Cache sessions, patches, PR metadata

[ ] Store in: ~/.cache/jules/



---

22. Add plugin architecture

[ ] Detect plugins via Python entry_points

[ ] Enable pip install jules-plugin-xyz

[ ] Auto-register CLI commands



---

🚀 PHASE 7 — LONG-TERM FUTURE

23. Create background daemon (julesd)

[ ] Auto-watch repo

[ ] Detect test failures

[ ] Auto-run autofix

[ ] Notify user



---

24. Develop GUI application

[ ] Tauri / Electron / web UI

[ ] History viewer

[ ] Patch viewer

[ ] PR dashboard

[ ] Live session monitor



---

25. Add enterprise telemetry (opt-in only)

[ ] Anonymous aggregate metrics

[ ] Performance timings

[ ] Patch success rates

[ ] Configurable via:

[ ] config file

[ ] env vars




---

📌 Usage

You can paste tasks from each phase directly into Jules as discrete sessions.
The order has been optimized for dependency clarity, minimal rework, and maximum scalability.
